<h1> File Operations in Ruby </h1>
<hr>
<p> This file contains all basic file operations of Ruby language  </p>

<p> In the above script I used simple file operations </p>
<p> like Creating a file </p>
<p> Reading a file </p>

<br> 
 <p> I given a switch statement to swith a particular option </p>
 <p> 1. create 2. read like that </p>
 <p> to select 1 after you should give the file name (destination to store) and you can type some thing after finish the matter you can hit ctrl+d to save the script
 </p>
 <p> like that reading option also we have to give the source file to open the file </p>
